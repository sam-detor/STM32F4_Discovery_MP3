How to use the offloading framework:
1. Put all your code that you would like to offload in a method called offloadedCode with the following method signature:
                       int __attribute__((section(".text.offloaded"))) offloadedCode(void)

2. Call the method remoteInit in place of where you would call offloadedCode. remoteInit takes two arguments (USART_TypeDef* USARTx and volatile uint32_t* systick_ms).
   USARTx should be a pointer to a properly initialized USART_TypeDef object and systick_ms should be a uint32_t pointer to a variable that is incremented every ms. 
   The USART_TypeDef is defined in stm32f4xx.h

3. Call the method remoteInitSVC at the begining of your SVC_Handler method

4. Declare the offloadedCode, remoteInit, and remoteInitSVC methods in the relevant places

5. Fill in the following #defines in RemoteInit.h file (all of the following values are in bytes):
    a. RAM_CODE_START --> where you want your code in the RAM to start (as to not overwrite your data section, bss, etc). This must be written in hex
    b. RAM_STACK_SIZE --> how large of a stack does your RAM code need (also must be written in hex)
    d. WORD_SIZE --> how big are the words for you MCU, default is 4, should work for most people

6. In InitCode.ld replace {RAM_CODE_START} with the same value you put in RemoteInit.h

7. Add the following flags to your normal compile/link process: -ffunction-sections -Wl,--gc-section -Wl,
   This makes sure that methods that are not called will not appear in the final binary  

8. Now compile and link your as you normally would, but use the initBinStartUp.s file instead of your usual startup file and use the InitCode.ld
   linker script generated by the script in the previous step. Name the output file InitCode.bin
   and put it here: Offloading/remoteInitPC/bin. This is your offloaded code binary.

9. Using your method of choice, determine the file size of your InitCode.bin file and set the INIT_BIN_SIZE #define in RemoteInit.h accordingly

10. Make the remoteInitBoard library by running "make remoteInitBoard"

11. Make your code normally (but don't forget the extra flags from step 7) and link the remoteInitBoard as you would any other static lib

12. Make and run (in the background) the code that will send the InitCode.bin to the board by running "make remoteInitPC"

13. Flash your board, and your program will run normally
